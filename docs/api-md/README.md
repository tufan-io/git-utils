# @tufan/git-utils

[![action-ci](https://github.com/tufan-io/git-utils/workflows/action-ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tufan-io/git-utils/actions)

Convenience methods for working with git for tufan code-generation capabilities.
Uses `isomorphic-git`, to provide OS independence. Exremely useful for full featured
code generators.

tufan.cloud is a code generator and a registry system. All of which require
some git interactions. This is a simple wrapper around `isomorphic-git` that
exposes a few convenience functions to make these tasks easier.

As a proof of how good `isomorphic-git` is, this module is really a container
for one-liners with some data-transformation. In addition to providing convenience
wrappers for a few code-generation/code-management tasks, this module is really
a container to isolate the needed test cases.

## Usage

### Installation

# set registry config
